## Stretch Goals
- Different difficulty: Easy (7 Guesses), Medium (5 Guesses), Hard (3 Guesses)
- Have buffs and debuffs to give unique situations for my game modes. Such as, in hard mode, adding bombs to letters, which clicking on them will increase your wrong guesses by 2. While also adding buffs will increase your max number of wrong guesses so it gives you more lives
- Endless timer mode: Guess as many words as you can in 1 min. 
- API Integration so the pool of words are endless
- More Hints: Reveal one letter at an expense of increasing your wrong guesses
- Add Sound and music for correct guesses, wrong guesses, game lost and game won. 
- Add in animations like screenshake.
